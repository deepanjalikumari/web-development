## 🚀 Project Overview

This platform empowers users to **resell and share unused or partially used goods and experiences** in a social, community-driven way. While it includes _ticket reselling_ (concerts, sports, travel, gaming, etc.), it also extends to other scenarios like **sharing food orders, event passes, and group experiences**.

Imagine you bought 10 concert tickets but two friends cancel last minute.  
Instead of losing money, you can either:

- _Resell those tickets to others_ at any price you set,
- Or _invite new people to join your group socially_, so no one misses out and everyone enjoys together.

Similarly, if you ordered a large pizza but can’t finish it, you can **resell or share slices** with others nearby who want some.

## 🛠️ Current Progress

We’re actively working on the backend and architecture:

- ✅ User authentication & profiles
- ✅ Password reset & account management
- ✅ Create and manage resellable items
- ✅ Geo-based discovery for nearby listings
- ✅ Admin flow for safe approvals
- 🔄 Currently building:
  - **Experience Rooms** — social spaces where users can:
    - Share what they’re doing in real-time
    - Invite others to join virtually or in-person
    - Post media, chat, and later even video-call
  - Public/private modes, 1-on-1 chats, and room invites
- 🔜 Planned: Real-time voice/video rooms for deeper shared moments

## 💡 Monetization Ideas

- 💸 **2% commission on every ticket sold** – A small cut from each transaction keeps the platform running and growing.
- 🚀 **Premium & Featured Listings** – Sellers can boost visibility with spotlighted posts.
- 🤝 **Partnerships & Collabs** – Team up with event organizers, food platforms, or travel companies for exclusive deals and integrations.
- 📢 **Targeted Ads** – Smart, relevant ads for people looking for events, food, or fun nearby.
